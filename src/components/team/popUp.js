            After gaining rich experience in the fields of Advertising and
            fashion designing, Ankita joined Brands Impact where she heads a
            team of young and dynamic marketing professionals. With her

            brand concepts and designs. She is one of the youngest and most
            successful woman achievers in the branding and marketing domains. An
            ultimate people's person, Ankita's striking spirit and leadership
            skills has helped her team members grow into successful marketers

            Ankita is also one of the very few gifted designers who owe their
            success only to their talent and not to any design school. She has
            designed for, and been appreciated by, several socialites and
            Bollywood divas including Karisma Kapoor, Soha Ali Khan and Raveena

            A firm believer in personal growth, Ankita has achieved success
            through her keen desire to express herself either through her
            creations or her sales pitches, which clients tend to find
            absolutely irresistible!
